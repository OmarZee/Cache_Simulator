Project 2: Cache Performance

In this project, we aim to explore the functioning of caches and examine how different cache parameters influence performance. We will develop a Direct-mapped stimulator and Fully-associative  simulator and validate its correctness. The simulator will then be used to conduct various experiments, and the results will be analyzed. We will study 6 different memory access patterns that we will be naming memGen1 to memGen6.
