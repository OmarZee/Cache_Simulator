#Project 2: Cache Performance

In this project, we aim to explore the functioning of caches and examine how different cache parameters influence performance. We will develop a Direct-mapped stimulator and Fully-associative  simulator and validate its correctness. The simulator will then be used to conduct various experiments, and the results will be analyzed. We will study 6 different memory access patterns that we will be naming memGen1 to memGen6.

##Dependencies
  VScode, excel and matlab.

##Files
  1) 231-proj2-1.pdf: contains the project description.
  2) DM_Graph.jpg: graph showing the results of the hit rate against different line sizes. (graph made using MATLAB)
  3) FA_Graph.jpg: graph showing the results of the hit rate against different line sizes. (graph made using MATLAB)
  4) Test cases used for DM.txt: list of addresses that were tested on the direct mapping cache to ensure that it is working correctly.
  5) Test cases used for FA.txt: list of addresses that were tested on the fully associative cache to ensure that it is working correctly.
  6) cache.cpp: The main source code of the project.
  7) cache.exe: The executable file of the cache simulator.

##Building and running
  Building and running the simulator is done from the VScode not from terminal.
